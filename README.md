# WordRush
Word Rush is a console-based word finding game developed in Python. Players are presented with word definitions and must guess the corresponding word within a limited time. They can choose to receive letters to make the game easier, but doing so will affect their overall score. The game features different difficulty levels, a scoring system based on time and letter usage, and a leaderboard to track player scores.
